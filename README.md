# VBAProject-SP500-Address-Scraper

## *Overview*
- Quick web scraping code I wrote to grab address information from SEC's EDGAR.
- List of S&P 500 companies came from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies.
- The scraper grabs text between span tags with a class of mailerAddress.
- The code could be improved by getting it to automatically differentiate between the mailing address and business address.
